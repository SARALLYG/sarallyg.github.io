      <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
      <p><strong>By Evan Wild</strong></p>

      <p>
        Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures,
        self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from
        renowned documentary, The Jungle Book.
      </p>

      <p>
        So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision?
        In this article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
      </p>

      <h3>Types of bear</h3>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>
      <p>
        Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients. In general
        they will hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down their
        sustenance from farms or country houses. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Urban (gentrified) bears on the other hand have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt other urban
        creatures if necessary (including other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer to scavenge from readily
        available urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints. When food has proven scarce, urban
        bears have even been known to break into people's kitchens and steal essentials like baked beans, ready meals,
        and microwave ovens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks, to the toilets in McDonalds, to their
        own apartment.
      </p>

      <h3>Mating rituals</h3>
      <p>
        Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a mate that they can spend the rest of
        their lives with. They will woo a potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive — for example with
        cave paintings or a bed of reeds in the case of a wild bear, and mood lighting and a Michael Bublé CD in the
        case of an urban bear.

                Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their sniffing
                little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of putting them all
                in a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.
